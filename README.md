# lua-vector
A simple vector (mathematics) implementation in Lua 5.3.

## Getting started
### Installation
Just simply copy the file `precompiled/vector.lua` (lua bytecode file, recommended) or `vector.lua` (lua text file) to one of the lua module directories (on my computer, they are `/usr/share/lua/5.3` and `/usr/lib/lua/5.3`).

### Usage
Execute the command `lua -lvector` to start lua with the module loaded, or just simply run `lua` and then enter `require("vector");` in the interactive mode of lua.

An example file (`example.lua`) using this module is also included. Please read it for more specific information.
